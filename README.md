My submission for the Reinvent:YU May 2016 hackathon.

An app where YU students can find out what there is to do without having to deal with all the YStuds. 
If you want to set up an event, you have to clear it with Student Life before the email goes out;
now, you can make events here and cut out the middleman!

You can create events and give them a time, place, and amount of people you're looking for. 
Other people can see what events are happening, and decide to join ones they're interested in.
